Historical-Trends-and-Forecast-Future-Shoreline-Changes-1974-2024 using Satellites with Machine Learning in the Niger Delta

Overview

The Niger Delta, one of the world's largest river deltas, has been experiencing significant shoreline changes over the past several decades due to various environmental and anthropogenic factors. These changes are critical to understand for sustainable coastal management and environmental conservation in this highly dynamic and ecologically sensitive region. In this project, we aim to analyze historical shoreline trends from 1974 to 2024 and forecast future changes using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques.

By integrating multi-temporal satellite data with advanced machine learning algorithms, we can model the rate of shoreline change and predict future trends with high accuracy. This README.md provides a detailed overview of the objectives, methodology, and data used in this project.
Project Objectives

    Historical Shoreline Analysis: To assess the historical changes in the Niger Delta shoreline from 1974 to 2024 using multi-temporal satellite imagery.
    Shoreline Change Detection: To analyze the spatial-temporal patterns of shoreline erosion and accretion using machine learning models.
    Future Shoreline Forecasting: To predict future shoreline changes using time series data from historical satellite imagery and predictive machine learning algorithms.
    Erosion and Accretion Drivers: To identify key factors driving shoreline changes, including natural processes (e.g., sediment deposition, sea-level rise) and human activities (e.g., oil exploration, deforestation).
    Policy Implications: To provide insights that can inform coastal management policies aimed at mitigating erosion and promoting sustainable development.

Methodology
1. Data Collection
Satellite Imagery

The primary data source for this analysis consists of satellite imagery from various platforms, covering the period from 1974 to 2024:

    Landsat (1974–2023): We used Landsat imagery for the historical analysis due to its extensive archive and moderate spatial resolution. Landsat images were acquired at 30-meter resolution, which provides adequate detail for shoreline change detection.
    Sentinel-1 & 2 (2014–2024): Higher-resolution imagery from the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors were used for more recent analysis.
    Google Earth Engine: Google Earth Engine's cloud computing platform was utilized to preprocess and analyze the satellite images efficiently.

Environmental Data

To model the drivers of shoreline change, we collected additional environmental datasets, including:

    Rainfall Data: Historical rainfall records were obtained from meteorological stations in the region, as rainfall intensity contributes to sediment deposition and erosion.
    Tide and Wave Data: Oceanographic data related to tides and wave energy were incorporated to assess their impact on shoreline dynamics.
    Land Use/Land Cover Data: Changes in land cover, particularly mangrove deforestation, were factored into the analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing
Image Preprocessing

The satellite images were preprocessed to ensure consistent quality and accuracy. This involved several steps:

    Cloud Masking: To remove cloud cover from the images, cloud-masking algorithms were applied, particularly for Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery.
    Georeferencing: Images were georeferenced to ensure alignment with ground truth data and ensure uniform spatial resolution.
    Shoreline Extraction: Using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), we extracted the shorelines from each satellite image. This method differentiates between water and land, allowing for precise shoreline delineation.

Feature Engineering

For machine learning modeling, we created several features based on the satellite data:

    Shoreline Position: The latitude and longitude of the shoreline at different time intervals.
    Shoreline Change Metrics: Metrics such as the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and End Point Rate (EPR) were calculated to quantify historical shoreline changes.
    Elevation Data: DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data were used to analyze the topography of coastal areas and how elevation impacts erosion.

3. Machine Learning Modeling

We employed machine learning algorithms to detect shoreline changes and forecast future trends:
Historical Shoreline Change Detection

    Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM was applied for land-water classification, allowing accurate delineation of the shoreline in historical satellite images.
    Random Forest: Random Forest was used to model the relationship between environmental factors (rainfall, wave energy, land cover) and shoreline change, identifying key drivers of erosion and accretion.

Future Shoreline Prediction

To predict future shoreline changes from 2024 onwards, we used time series models such as:

    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, was used to model the temporal dependencies in shoreline position data. LSTM is well-suited for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies.
    Linear Regression: Linear regression was used as a baseline model to compare the predictive power of machine learning models against simpler statistical approaches.

4. Validation and Accuracy Assessment

To ensure the reliability of the machine learning models, we performed cross-validation using a portion of the historical data. Accuracy was measured using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Additionally, the model predictions were validated against known shoreline positions derived from more recent satellite imagery (2023–2024).
5. Results and Discussion
Historical Shoreline Trends (1974–2024)

    Erosion Hotspots: Analysis revealed several erosion hotspots along the Niger Delta coastline, particularly in areas with significant human activities such as oil exploration and dredging. The average erosion rate in these areas was found to be 2.5 meters per year.
    Accretion Zones: Some regions, particularly around river mouths and estuaries, showed accretion due to sediment deposition. Accretion rates in these areas averaged 1.8 meters per year.
    Impact of Land Use: Deforestation of mangrove forests was identified as a major factor contributing to erosion. Areas with significant mangrove loss experienced erosion rates nearly double that of forested areas.

Future Shoreline Forecast (2024–2034)

    Predicted Erosion Rates: Based on the machine learning models, erosion is expected to continue at an accelerated rate in the absence of intervention. By 2034, some areas may experience a shoreline retreat of up to 30 meters.
    Impact of Sea-Level Rise: Rising sea levels, compounded by subsidence in certain areas of the Niger Delta, are expected to exacerbate erosion.
    Recommended Mitigation Strategies: The findings underscore the need for immediate interventions, such as mangrove restoration and the implementation of sustainable dredging practices, to mitigate future erosion.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of integrating satellite imagery with machine learning to analyze historical shoreline changes and predict future trends. The results of this analysis have significant implications for coastal management in the Niger Delta, providing data-driven insights that can inform policy decisions and promote sustainable development.

Future work will involve refining the predictive models by incorporating additional environmental variables such as subsidence rates and anthropogenic activity data. Moreover, the project will be expanded to include real-time monitoring capabilities using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from Sentinel-1.
